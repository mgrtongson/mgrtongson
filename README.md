Q1 Project Proposal

Working Title: Team Maliwagnag

Description: 
                    Nowadays, hundreds of millions of people use the internet every single day and use it to connect with others and to also retrieve information in order to be aware of trending events happening at the moment. Unfortunately, the straightforwardness on the use of the internet has also brought an easy path for what is called misinformation which mostly spreads like wildfire sometimes. Several people sometimes have a hard time believing something is too good to be true, so this website is dedicated to such people who need this help.
                    This website comes from the key terms ‚Äúmali‚Äù, ‚Äúhuwag‚Äù, and ‚Äúmaliwanag‚Äù, combining to mean ‚Äúto prevent spreading of malinformation by thinking brightly‚Äù. The webpages are intended to be a mini-guide to collecting information while looking up resources on the internet regarding a certain topic, from scientific to political trends. By the end of reading each webpage, the user of the website will have a better picture of the internet and preventing to fall into any possible hazard for a potential malinformation situation.


Outline: 
                  Home page: The Maliwagnag Gang - Meet who we are and why we are here and why you must be here while browsing through countless resources troubling to identify what‚Äôs reliable or not.
                  Page 1: Definition of the Internet - Learn more about what the internet really intends to be and how its foundations have led to its development at present
                  Page 2: Witnesses and Information - This is the foundation of when any reported situation or incident is being witnessed by entities around.
                  Page 3: Incident on Trending - When a serious situation arises, several reporters and researchers drop by the incident. Not everyone interprets it the same though, so the messages each one wishes to convey could vary too.
                  Page 4: Skepticism of Resource Content - To gather reliable information, no matter how many pages may connect to each other relating to a presumable situation, it‚Äôs important to analyze the pages one reads in several ways.
                  Page 5: It‚Äôs on your hands now - The way how one interprets the intentions of a resource can impact on what they do with such a situation, so it‚Äôs very crucial to impact their social, economical, and community life.
